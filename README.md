# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a Multiple Disease Prediction Systemthat uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person has one of the following diseases:

1. Heart Disease Prediction
2.Parkinson's Disease Prediction
3. Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

The system uses the following machine learning models for prediction:
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) for Parkinson's Diseaseand Diabetes prediction.
- Logistic Regression forHeart Diseaseprediction.

A Streamlituser interface (UI) allows users to input their health data and predict if they have any of these diseases.


## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit for building the user interface
- SVM for **Parkinson's and Diabetes prediction
- Logistic Regression** for Heart Disease prediction

## How to Run the Application

 1. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
